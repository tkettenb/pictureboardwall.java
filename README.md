# pictureboardwall.java
Just a collection of java code snippets.

## Playfully experiments with java

The example files here are mostly lightweight and are used to
demonstrate java concept. All of them could be run as easy as:

    javac <java-class>.java
    java [options] <java-class>

# Disclaimer

There is no specific reason behind this. I am collecting stuff that
i come across.
